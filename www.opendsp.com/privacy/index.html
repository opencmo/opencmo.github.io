	<br />
	<h3>Platform Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>This privacy statement below applies to our OpenDSP online 
advertising technology platform (the Platform). If you have any 
questions about this information, please&nbsp;<a href="http://opendsp.com/contact-us">CONTACT US HERE</a>.</p>
<p>Direct link to Opt-Out:&nbsp;<a href="http://opendsp.com/opt-out">CLICK HERE</a>.</p>
<h3>THE  PLATFORM</h3>
<p>OpenDSP is a technology platform (Platform) that allows our clients 
to buy, through real-time bidding, and serve online advertising, 
including interest-based, or behavioral, advertising and retargeting, as
 well as conduct data analysis and run A/B testing experiments. The 
platform enables clients to make buying decisions using non-PII, which 
is collected by the clients both utilizing platform~s capabilities and 
through other channels. Platform uses some of the non-PII information 
collected by the clients for optimization of clients~ advertising 
campaigns, for analytics, and reporting.</p>
<p>
We receive information about consumers from third parties to enable targeted advertising on the website(s) and application(s) that we support. The collection and use of that data is governed by the privacy policy and legal terms of the data collector and the website using the data; it is not governed by OpenDSP.
</p>
<h3>OPENDSP COOKIE STATEMENT</h3>
<p>Although the specific cookies may change from time to time, this 
describes the purposes for which the OpenDSP Platform uses cookies. For a
 detailed description of cookies set by the Platform, see Platform 
Cookies.</p><ul><li>The Platform uses unique cookies to identify web browsers and to 
store data to facilitate clients~ in their advertising, including 
interest-based advertising; to facilitate clients~ own analytics and 
modeling; and for Platform~s marketing analytics, predictive analytics, 
and reporting on behalf of the clients.</li></ul><ul class="disc"><li>The Platform uses unique cookies to collect and store data on web 
browser activities related to clients~ advertising purposes, including 
data related to ad delivery and reporting data, such as, for example, 
which ad was shown, the number of times a particular ad has been shown, 
and how recently an ad has been shown to a particular web browser; as 
well as responses to the ads, such as clicks, visits to advertiser 
sites, conversions, etc.;</li><li>By contract, Platform clients are prohibited from associating Platform cookies with any PII.</li><li>The Platform uses unique cookies to track users~ responses (clicks and conversions) to ads purchased on the platform.</li><li>The Platform uses non-unique cookies to store users~ opt-out choices.</li><li>The Platform enables clients to use information provided by 
third-party sources. Clients and third parties use ID synching to enable
 the use of this information through the Platform.</li><li>The Platform is designed to use only non-PII, and OpenDSP has 
contractual provisions that prohibit clients of the Platform from 
associating Platform cookies with PII.</li></ul>
<p>In the context of Non-PII, whenever we refer to ~you~ or ~yours,~ 
please remember that we may be referring to a computer and not an 
identifiable person since we generally do not know who is using a 
computer at any particular time. Data collected by or using the Platform
 about internet traffic and usage is not personally identifying or 
identifiable, and is not supplemented or combined with personally 
identifying or identifiable information by OpenDSP. OpenDSP may share 
the non-personal, traffic or click-stream information it collects with 
its advertising clients and certain selected third parties, such as data
 and service providers, either in raw or in aggregated, but only in 
anonymous form. OpenDSP~s servers collect non-personal information about
 the publisher~s website which you visited and may have been presented 
an offer/advertisement and provides access to that information to the 
Platform~s clients. For example, an advertising client may have access 
to the browsing history of anonymous users. Also, OpenDSP notes some of 
the clients~ websites you visit through the use of pixel tags. The 
information collected by OpenDSP through the use of these pixel tags is 
not personally identifiable. In addition to the foregoing, OpenDSP uses 
the information (in aggregate form) for modeling on behalf of Platform~s
 clients to optimize anonymous user~s experience with and response to 
the clients~ advertising. </p>
<p>Furthermore, we collect Non-PII through the use of cookies, pixels 
and related technologies managed by OpenDSP, our partners and vendors.&nbsp; A
 cookie is a file on your browser that uniquely identifies your browser 
and computer.&nbsp; A pixel is a line of code which is used by a website or 
third party to assign online activities to a computer or browser.&nbsp; The 
use of a pixel allows websites and us to record, for example, that a 
user has visited a particular web page.&nbsp; Additional Non-PII from an 
earlier period or interaction may be included in the pixel.&nbsp; Though 
Non-PII does not personally identify anyone, we are still committed to 
giving users the opportunity to exercise choice about the Non-PII we 
collect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A cookie is a small text file containing a string of characters that 
is placed by an online server on your hard drive. A session ID cookie 
expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your
 hard drive for an extended period of time. We use persistent cookies to
 store the non-personally identifiable information described above, and 
to store inferences we make based on that non-personally identifiable 
information about what a user~s interests might be. Most web browsers 
are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can change your web 
browser settings to cause your browser to refuse cookies or to indicate 
when a cookie is being sent. You can remove and/or disable cookies by 
following directions provided in your Internet web browser~s Y´help¡ file

 or menu.</p>
<p>Our cookies do not harm your computer in any way or provide us with 
any information about your identity. We do not install software of any 
kind on your computer and have no ability to monitor or track your 
general computer or overall internet usage. Cookies can be easily 
avoided by opting out from them or by adjusting your browser settings.</p>
<p>You can also opt-out of the collection of data through cookies by 
clicking the red opt-out button located on the upper right hand side of 
this page (entitled ´Click Here to opt out from our behavioral 

advertising¡).</p>

<p>We collect Non-PII through the use of cookies, pixels and related 
technologies managed by MediaCrossing, our partners and vendors.&nbsp; A 
cookie is a file on your browser that uniquely identifies your browser 
and computer.&nbsp; A pixel is a line of code which is used by a website or 
third party to assign online activities to a computer or browser.&nbsp; The 
use of a pixel allows websites and us to record, for example, that a 
user has visited a particular web page.&nbsp; Additional Non-PII from an 
earlier period or interaction may be included in the pixel.&nbsp; Though 
Non-PII does not personally identify anyone, we are still committed to 
giving users the opportunity to exercise choice about the Non-PII we 
collect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
We receive information about consumers from third parties to enable targeted advertising on the website(s) and application(s) that we support. The collection and use of that data is governed by the privacy policy and legal terms of the data collector and the website using the data; it is not governed by OpenDSP.
</p>
<h3>FOR WHAT PURPOSES DO WE USE THE INFORMATION?</h3>
<ul class="disc"><li>OpenDSP uses the information collected on the Platform to provide, operate, manage, maintain, and enhance the Platform.</li><li>OpenDSP may act as a client of the Platform to advertise its business online. <br></li><li>The Platform enables OpenDSPF~s clients to use non-PII OpenDSP and 
clients collect to buy and sell online advertising, including 
interest-based advertising, using real-time bidding.</li><li>Particular advertising-related purposes for which OpenDSP~s clients may use the non-PII collected on the platform include:
<ul class="disc"><li>Building models to predict, optimize, and customize clients~ online advertising strategy</li><li>Interest-based advertising (To opt out of interest-based advertising
 on the Platform, go to the Y´What are your choices?¡ section below.)</li><li>Customizing ads to a particular geographic region</li><li>Running A/B testing experiments to analyze and optimize usersF~ response to the ads served by the clients on the Platform.</li><li>Reporting aggregated statistics regarding, for example, the effectiveness of online advertising campaigns</li></ul>

</li></ul>
<p>Typically, companies using Platform own the data that they provide to
 and collect through the Platform, while OpenDSP owns and provides 
access to the data it collects on behalf of its clients. While the 
Platform is designed to use only non-PII, and Platform clients are 
prohibited from bringing PII onto the Platform, when clients remove data
 from the platform, their use of data is governed by their own privacy 
policies and applicable laws, rules, or regulations.</p>
<h3>WHAT INFORMATION DOES OpenDSP SHARE WITH THIRD PARTIES?</h3>
<p>OpenDSP may, to operate or enhance Platform~s services, provide 
access to data collected on the Platform to clients, partners, and 
service providers. OpenDSP may provide, or enable others to collect, 
information for purposes of detecting and preventing fraudulent activity
 or invalid traffic, for measuring the time an ad is in-view, In 
addition, OpenDSP may disclose such information in the event we 
reasonably suspect malicious activity or invalid traffic, or believe 
that we are legally required to do so. OpenDSP may also share aggregated
 data derived from the Platform, including, for example, statistics 
about Platform activity. Finally, we may transfer Platform data to a 
successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, 
sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change.</p>
<h3>HOW IS THE INFORMATION STORED AND HOW LONG IS IT KEPT?</h3>
<ul class="disc"><li>OpenDSP uses generally accepted industry security standards on the Platform.</li><li>Non-PII stored in the platform is retained in the Platform in 
non-aggregated form for up to 18 months from the date of collection. 
Aggregated data is used for reporting and analysis, and may be stored in
 the Platform for up to 2 additional years.</li></ul>
<h3>SECURITY OF DATA STORED BY OPENDSP</h3>
<p>OpenDSP has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, 
and alteration of the information under our control. While we make 
reasonable efforts to ensure the integrity and security of our network 
and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent
 third parties from illegally obtaining this information. You agree that
 neither OpenDSP nor the clients shall be liable or responsible if any 
information about you is intercepted and used by an unintended 
recipient.</p>
<h3><a name="choices"></a>WHAT ARE YOUR CHOICES?</h3>

<p><strong>OpenDSP Web Browser Opt Out:</strong> You can click below to 
opt out of having the Platform used to select ads for your browser based
 on your online web browsing behavior. When you opt out, an opt-out 
cookie (from opendsp.com) will be stored in your web browser. The 
Platform will know the choice you have made when it sees your opt out 
cookie, and will apply your choice to all companies~ use of the 
Platform. If you block or delete the opt-out cookie, the Platform will 
not see your choice.</p>
<ul class="disc"><li><strong>The opt out cookie cannot be set if your browser is configured to block third-party cookies.</strong></li><li>If you delete your cookies, you will need to opt out again. There 
are browser plugins to help you preserve your opt out cookies. For more 
information, please visit&nbsp;<a href="HTTP://WWW.ABOUTADS.INFO/PMC">HTTP://WWW.ABOUTADS.INFO/PMC</a>.</li><li>The opt out only applies to the browser in which you set it. For 
example, if you set the opt out while using Firefox, but then use 
Chrome, the opt out will not be active in Chrome. To opt out in Chrome, 
you will need to repeat the opt-out process.</li><li>The opt out does not block or delete cookies, or prevent the use of 
cookies or other technologies for purposes other than selecting ads 
based on your interests as inferred by your online behavior. If you opt 
out, data may still be collected about your web browsing activities and 
you will still see advertising. Ads may be selected, for example, based 
on the content of the web page in which they are shown. If you wish to 
block or delete cookies altogether, you can use web browser settings to 
do so. See the&nbsp;<a href="http://opendsp.com/privacy-policy/#top">RESOURCES ABOVE</a>&nbsp;for more information.</li><li>To learn more about interest-based advertising, and to access the
